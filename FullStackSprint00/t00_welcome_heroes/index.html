        <h2 id="111"> <b>What makes a superhero?</b></h2>
        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. 
            So in order to be a superhero, 
             <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,
   
             </b>  
            and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.
            Otherwise a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
           </p>
           <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
               But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. 
               If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

       <p>Spider-woman</p>
       <p>Spider-Woman is a superhero that appears in Marvel Comics, created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Since his first appearance on the pages of the comic strip Amazing Fantasy # 15 (Russian Amazing Fantasy, August 1962), he has become one of the most popular superheroes. 
          Lee and Ditko conceived of the character as an orphan teen, raised by an uncle and aunt, combining the life of an ordinary student and a crime fighter. 
          Spider-Woman gained superpowers, increased agility, "spider flair", as well as the ability to stay on steep surfaces and release cobwebs from his hands using a device of his own invention.
